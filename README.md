# Vaadin Create 2025 Theming Lab Example

A simple Vaadin app with a non-functional form used to demonstrate how styling is done in Vaadin 25.

Run the application with `./mvnw` from the command line, or by running the `Application.java` class from your IDE ("Debug with Hotswap").

## Resources

The proper documentation for Vaadin component base styles and the Aura theme is still under development. For now, here are a couple of resources to help out:

- [List of base style custom properties](base-style-props.md)
- [List of Aura theme custom properties](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DfkK0X6KBWl2JONPPbWaN33RjbJjLJYBkRE-ma15wV4/edit?usp=sharing)
